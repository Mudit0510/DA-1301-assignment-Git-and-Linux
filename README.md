## Q)What i like best about git
I like that git offers us a version control which helps us in managing large projects and it is free for all to use.

## Q)Which python assignment problem i liked the most
I liked the problem where I had to compare the runtimes of Linear search and binary search using time module and plot a graph using matplotlib as it introduced me to a new module and showed me proper runtimes for different lengths of input and how binary search is faster than linear search.Checking and verifying this on my own and coding this on my own was very interesting for me and i liked it the most.
